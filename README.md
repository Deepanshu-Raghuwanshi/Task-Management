Task Management Application

Project Setup

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Deepanshu-Raghuwanshi/Task-Management.git
cd Task-Management

---

2. Install Dependencies

Frontend (FE)

cd fe
npm install # or yarn install

Backend (BE)

cd be
npm install # or yarn install

---

3. Environment Variables

Frontend (fe/.env)

BE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

Backend (be/.env)

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<your_mongodb_connection>
JWT_SECRET=<your_secure_jwt_secret>
PORT=5000

## Note: Replace <your_mongodb_connection> with your actual MongoDB connection string and <your_secure_jwt_secret> with a strong, randomly generated secret.

Why use JWT_SECRET from .env?

Security: Keeps the JWT secret key private, preventing unauthorized access.

Environment Flexibility: Different keys can be used for development, staging, and production.

Best Practices: Follows industry standards for secure application development.

## This application follows the 12-Factor App principles for better maintainability and security.
